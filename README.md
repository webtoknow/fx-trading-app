# Banking Software Design

During this course, we will learn about the whole process and all concepts involved in building an enterprise application from scratch. Starting with an idea and some wireframes, together we will analyze, develop, test and publish our application.

Each week will be an opportunity to understand theoretical concepts and apply them in punctual exercises. In the end, we will obtain a functional Forex trading application with capabilities to buy and sell currencies, and view all transactions made by other users.
