Partitioning:

0-1000 		dob 1% (values taken - 15, 500, 900)
1001-2000 	dob 2% (values taken - 1005, 1500, 1999)
2001-5000	dob 5% (values taken - 2002, 2500, 4999)

Boundary:
case 1. 0-1000 (tested values-> -1,0,1,999,1000,1001)
case 2. 1001-2000 (tested values -> 1002, 1999, 2000, 2001)
case 3. 2001-5000


Cause and effect:
case 1. open account -> 0 currency added -> 0% interest, add 100 currency -> 1% interest (final result 101)
add 499 -> 600 currency (606 after interest)
add 1000 currency > 1600 (1632 after interest) remove all currency -> 0 and 0% interest

Waterfall model:

Requirement gathering and analysis -> development -> testing -> release
Done in stages over long periods of time

Agile model:
small sprints which gather requirements, develop and test all given features


SaFe -> Scaled Agile
Used for very large teams.
Splitting the teams into smaller ones which take the agile model and work in parallel.
